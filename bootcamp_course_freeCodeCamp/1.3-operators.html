    COMPARISON OPERATORS

    ==   -> const example = 20 == '20'; -> you will get true
    ==  -> converts the values into the same type of values and then checks if the results are equal.


    !=  !==   -> they are the reverse of == ===
    // you can't compare arrays and objects  -> use lodash() to do it

    &&   = and
    ||   = or
    !    = reverse

    %  -> check below to understand how it works



let exp = 105 % 50;
console.log(exp); -> this will result to 5

In JavaScript, the % operator is called the modulus operator. It returns the remainder of a division operation. Here’s an example:

let result = 10 % 3; // result will be 1
In this example, 10 divided by 3 is 3 remainder 1. So, 10 % 3 returns 1.

This operator is often used to determine if a number is even or odd. For example:



let number = 7;
if (number % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(number + " is even");
} else {
    console.log(number + " is odd");
}
In this code, number % 2 returns 0 for even numbers and 1 for odd numbers. So, the code checks if a number is even or odd and logs the result to the console.

Actually, the modulus operator % in JavaScript returns the remainder of a division operation. So, 100 % 50 equals 0 because 100 divided by 50 has no remainder. Similarly, 150 % 50 equals 0 because 150 divided by 50 also has no remainder.

If you try 151 % 50, it will equal 1 because 151 divided by 50 leaves a remainder of 1. The modulus operator is often used to determine if a number is divisible by another number (if a % b equals 0, then a is divisible by b). It’s also commonly used to cycle through values in a certain range, among other things. I hope this clarifies the use of the modulus operator in JavaScript!
